          <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Hi, I'm Lerato Rampai. I'm multi-talented with over 5+ years of experiences in a wide range of design 
        disciplines. My skillsets include product designing, UI, front end development and any other market defined 
        function-tale. I'm also a disciplinary maker with experience in being a manager, advisor, entrepreneur and 
        music enthusiast. I define myself by the work I want to do, I am an ambitious individual and therefore prefer 
        aquiring new skills and a new way to takle the one I already have as a way of challenging myself continuosly. 
        Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily inspired and more than willing to follow my 
        fascinations wherever they take me. I’m never satisfied to just come up with ideas, instead I have an almost 
        impulsive need to act on them. As an individual that is on her toes to aquire new skills, that has made me 
        resouceful and always willing to learn, with that being said it resulted in me being able to pick up new skills
          in a faster pace than an average person. I would like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the 
          course of my life and career. I currently work remotely with Global Software Innovations 
        and open for new opportunities.</p>
